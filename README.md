**GRADUATION PROJECT**

A system has been developed which detects the face of individuals from webcam and predicts the emotion of the individual using CNN or convolutional neural networks. This work is published as a paper in IJEAT. The pdf of the paper is included in the repo. This can be used on ad boards to show advertisements based on current mood of a person.



Face detection is done using Python OpenCV which uses HAAR features utilising the algorithm by Viola Jones which detects objects using a 
cascade of weak classifiers. For emotion detection, a CNN model is built and trained.
