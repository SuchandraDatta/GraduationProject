**TRAINING THE CNN**

To train the model, Google Colab or Colaboratory was used which is a free platform provided by Google to train intensive machine learning models
without the need for developers to buy prohibitively expensive hardware. The purchase of high-end graphics is helpful for training but these 
cards are not designed with training in mind. A better alternative is to use Tesla K80 but it is prohibitively expensive. 
Using Google Colab, the model is trained on Tesla K80 GPU in a short interval of time. Colab runs on GCP or Google Cloud Platform 
hence its robust and flexible. It recently added support for TPUs(tensor processing units) apart from existing GPU and CPU instances. 
Benefits:

•	Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 support

•	Free GPU acceleration. Running models on one virtual machine for maximum upto 12 hours.

•	Pre-installed libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

•	Built on top of Jupyter Notebook

•	Collaboration feature allows sharing the notebook among other developers without the need to download, install or run anything 
other than a browser. 

•	Supports bash commands.

•	Google Colab notebooks are stored on the drive so allows access from any device with internet connection.
